Initially learned to programming from grandad who worked for the MOD and Plessey then at school, mainly text based games, graphics and *cough hacking in the 1990's with BASIC, PASCAL and 68000 Assembley. 
Had a long break and decided to dip my toes into the world of Python in 2016 and have stayed ever since.
